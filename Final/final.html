        <h1>Visit Seattle!</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my Web 1.0 Website featuring Seattle attractions to visit!
        </p>
        <p>
            This maps intended audience is for tourists visiting Seattle.<br>
            It starts at the airport, and highlights the route to the city center.<br>
            There, tourists spots are highlighted with points, and some POIs are highlighted with polygons.<br>
            I chose this basemap because the real one I wanted, Thunderforest, requires an API key, and I wasn't going to do that just for a small project.<br>
            This basemap doesn't require a key, shows labels, has nice colors, and has general modes of travel<br>
            without being overly distracting. This was a good neutral, showing the relavent content like roads and parks, while having subdued colors.<br>
            As you can see, I've used several differnt plugins here, some more visible then others.<br>
            I had a very hard time with some of them due to poor documentation and abandoned projects that don't work anymore.<br>
            However, I've gotten everything at least into a working state that meets the critera. If given extra time (and money) I'd design an animated story map.<br>
            The last problem I had was with popup content. It's very difficult and time consuming to escape all the characters to embed HTML,<br>
            and get the popups resized to fit content properly. Nothing here is automatic. I would like everypop up to have special content,<br>
            but it's just too time consuming and tedious.
