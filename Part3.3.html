        <h1>Lab 5</h1>
        <p>
            Ok, we've got a lot to cover here so let's get started
        </p>
        <p>
            First order of business, the POINTS! aka markers
            <ul>
                <li>I added a mouseover event listner</li>
                <li>The mouseover event listners changes the opacity</li>
                <li>I set a popup event listner to listen for clicks on the new york icon</li>
                <li>The icon will change when clicked on for New York</li>
                <li>There's a couple custom settings for the icons</li>
            </ul>
            Second Order, LINES!
            <ul>
                <li>I-5 shows up as dashed</li>
                <li>I-5 has a custom end cap setting</li>
                <li>Mississipi River is super wide</li>
                <li>It's got custom end caps</li>
                <li>It's has custom unround corners</li>
            </ul>
            And finally the polygons!
            <ul>
                <li>Florida has its stroke turned off, making it a highlighter</li>
                <li>Custom stroke on wyoming</li>
                <li>Fill opacity has been changed</li>
                <li>Bevel ends!</li>
            </ul>
            Technically speaking even though I'm using lists, they are paragraphs because they are inside the p tags
        </p>
